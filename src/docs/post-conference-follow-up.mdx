## Introduction
There are a number of steps required to prepare Salesforce with the right data, carefully imported without error to make the follow-up process as efficient as possible for the sales user.
The loading of data and preparation of Salesforce is not a dependency before the salesperson can follow-up and communicate with the customer. The activity data can be easily incorporated into Salesforce as soon as it ready.

## List Cleaning, Sorting and Upload
In most cases the conference will produce a list of contact information for people that have either had their badge scanned or have noted their details down.
This list will need to be cleaned and upserted into Salesforce. The *accounts* will need to be reconciled against existing accounts and new ones created where appropriate. The contacts will need to be duplicate checked and reconciled against existing contacts too.
In tandem and resource permitting *'enriching'* the data will take place whereby the contact record will have further information against the record. This can be done in a variety of ways, manual, semi-automated and completely automated.

## Campaigns
A *Campaign* will contain all of the contacts as *Campaign Members* this is an object which wraps *Contacts* against a discrete marketing activity such as a conference but might also be a webinar, ad campaign etc.

## Map
A specific map will be generated for the conference displaying each account on a map so that clusters of accounts can be grouped together for demos in one trip.
the *Map Plotter* [LINK TO MAP PLOTTER ARTICLE HERE] tool can be used to make further maps for specific questions the user may have.
