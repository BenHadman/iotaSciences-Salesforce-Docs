## Quote Process
Quote issuing follows a similar staged process as opportunities.
Depending on the need for internal review of quotes this process may be shorter or as outlined below.

1. **Draft**
Initial stage after creation
2. **Needs Review**
(If applicable) Reviewer needs to check the quote
3. **Approved**
Reviewer approves the quote and issuer can send to customer
4. **Rejected**
Reviewer rejects the quote and uses the *Activity* pane to write a task for the issuer detailing what needs changing.
5. **Presented to Customer**
Issuer has sent to customer and is waiting for a reply
6. **Accepted**
Customer accepts the quote
7. **Declined**
Customer Declines the quote

## Generating a Quote PDF
Once the Quote has been set to approved status the quote issuer can create a *Quote PDF* which will generate the quote in PDF format, suitable for sending to a customer.

1. Click the *Create PDF* button in the top right of the screen
2. Review the generated PDF
3. Click *Save PDF*
4. *Download* or *Print* using the buttons in the PDF Viewer.

Each time the quote detail is amended a new PDF Quote will need to be generated, these versions will be numbered and listed in the *Quote PDFs* related list.

## Syncing the Quote to the Opportunity
Syncing the quote to the opportunity will replace the opportunity products listed.
The *Opportunity Amount* will be updated.

1. From the quote record view click the *Start Sync* button in the top right of the screen.

## Changes to a Quote
Any changes to a quote should be edited on the existing quote, all changes to fields are tracked. A second quote should not be generated as the tracking becomes split over >1 record and analytics will be skewed.
