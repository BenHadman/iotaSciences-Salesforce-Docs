## Introduction
An *Opportunity* is opened when sales opportunity opens with a *Contact*.
This object within Salesforce is designed to guide you through the iotaSciences Opportunity Process, gathering and inputting data into the CRM along the way.
*Probability* is a field which assigns a % probability to an opportunity turning into an order. This is a metric which can only be calculated accurately if opportunities are treated in the same way by following the established process. When a number of opportunities have been tracked through this process and turned into orders we will be able to accurately assign real probabilities to each stage. A number of other important sales metrics can also be derived from the dataset generated from guiding opportunities through a standardised opportunity process.
